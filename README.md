🩺 Breast Cancer Classification Model

A simple Machine Learning project that classifies whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-learn.
This was my first ML model, built to understand the basics of dataset loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

🧠 Objective

To build and test a basic classification model that can predict breast cancer diagnosis using real-world data.

🧰 Libraries Used
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

📊 Dataset

Dataset used: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

Available in Scikit-learn via load_breast_cancer()

Contains features like mean radius, texture, smoothness, and diagnosis labels (malignant/benign).

⚙️ Model Used

Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier (or specify the one you used if different)

Framework: Scikit-learn

Train-Test Split: 80:20

📈 Model Evaluation

Used metrics such as:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

💡 Learning Outcome

This project helped me understand:

The basic ML workflow (load → train → predict → evaluate)

How to use datasets from Scikit-learn

How evaluation metrics reflect model performance
